TODO this read me needs a lot of work.  Need to figure out how the next auth stuff actually works and make sure others can get this running on their local environment okay.  

Commands I've run : 
npm install idb mapbox-gl                            
npm install -D @types/mapbox-gl
npm install next-auth @auth/prisma-adapter
npx prisma migrate dev --name add-auth-discord
